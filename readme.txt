Adds a "Continue Reading →" link to Hand-Crafted Excerpts on Archive Pages (i.e. Blog).  Mainly for use with Studio Press Themes.

== Description ==

Adds a "Continue Reading →" link to Hand-Crafted Excerpts on Archive Pages (i.e. Blog Pages). Excerpts are optional hand-crafted summaries of your content, that show up on Archive Pages, RSS feeds, etc. Hand-crafting these summaries give you a SEO as well as click through advantage.

The "Excerpt" field may not display by default on your edit post page, if not, click "Screen Options" at the top of the page and check "Excerpt".

Mainly for use with StudioPress since StudioPress adds continue link to auto generated excerpts but not hand-crafted, but should work with other themes as well.  Just note that this only modifies output for posts you've entered text into the "Excerpt" field, and, for themes that display the "Excerpt" field on Archive Pages.
